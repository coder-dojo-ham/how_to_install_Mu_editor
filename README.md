Now type in these two lines of code - use your own name instead of "Gita" (unless your name **is** Gita, of course).

````
my_name = 'Gita'
print('Hello,', my_name)
````

Then click the `Save` button and give your program file a name - we called ours `hello`.

Can you guess what the program will do when you run it?

## 4. Run your program

Click the `Run` button and look at the new window that opens at the bottom of Mu.  This is where the Python `print` command sends its output. Did you guess right about what the program would do?
